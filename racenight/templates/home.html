                <li> Tickets are used to place bets</li>
                <li> Each ticket is worth 25p</li>  
                <li> There will be five races, each with eight horses</li>
                <li> First race starts at approximately 20:15, then every 15mins thereafter</li>
                <li> You can bet on as many horses as you like provided you have enough tickets</li>
                <li> There is a two minute countdown before each race begins</li>
                <li> Betting will close approximately 1 minute before the race starts</li>
                <li> Races are streamed 'live' via YouTube</li>
                <li> After the race is over, the payouts are calculated</li>
                <li> Payout per winning ticket is the number of tickets bet on the race (the pot) divided by the number of winning tickets</li>
                <li> If you've picked the winner then your account is automatically updated with your payout</li>
                <li> Details of the amount bet on each horse for each race will be available to view after the race is over</li>
                <li> If there are no winnings tickets for a race, then the pot is rolled over into the next race </li>
                <li> After the last race is over your tickets will be converted back into cash and you'll receive your payout from your Race Night rep :-)</li>
                <li> Remember it's just for fun!</li>
